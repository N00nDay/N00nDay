I am a Full-Stack Developer working in West Michigan.

I am passionate about clean and simple designs that just make sense to an end user. My experience is primarily centered around creating high performance web applications for companies looking to streamline their workflow and maximize their efficiency. 

I am currently working on [STWUI](https://github.com/N00nDay/stwui) a component library for Svelte and TailwindCSS projects.
